# SofiaServerCustomKeyMod
This xposed module captures the hardware keys from the Joying unit and allows you to reprogram them.
This should replace the custom key mod mod from Gustden. It mimics the same behavior and therefore also needs a launcher.sh

** Completely untested yet. it contains at least one bug which I can't currently fix due to my limited java knowledge **
